### Requirements

- You can only use the items provided with your Romi robot (line sensor array, 2 motors & encoders,).

- You may not add anything to the kit. 

### Assessment

*Robot performance (100 points)*

Your robot will have 150 seconds to perform the task. Your robot will have 3 chances to complete the task. Performance will be based on the means score of these runs:

- Straight line movement (30 points)
- Follow a line (2 x 15 points)
- Detect the end of the line (5 points)
- Return to home (max 35 points) 


1. Straight line movement
    Your robot must progress from the start location into Zone 2 without hitting any obstacles

## Marking

Each student has up to 3 opportunities to be assessed for this coursework. Each assessment consists of the best score out of 2 runs. One of these opportunities will be during the marking session. Students may also attempt the coursework during the lab sessions. If a student fails either task 1 or 2, they may continue from the next checkpoint to receive partial credit. In this case, students will not be able to receive points for task 4 for that particular run.
